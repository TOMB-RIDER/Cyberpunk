**No plugins means no third-party plugins here. There is still one or two plugins maybe, but they are allowed to use. (In fact I don't know whether those plugins are used or not, but anyway :)**

The original one includes some plugins that isn't availible on GitHub Pages.  
And using plugins seems to be difficult for amateurs.  
(yes i CAN'T understand what he write about the pucking flugins)   
So I try to make it become plugins-free (

It looks totally different between mine and the original one.  
~~I am going to write a blog (but in Chinese) later to introduce how to custom.~~
